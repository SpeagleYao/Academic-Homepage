My name is Yao Yiran, a junior undergraduate from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I love thinking about how to solve a hard but intriguing problem. Since my childhood, I have learned and attended mathematic competitions. When I was in high school, I came across coding and then attended OI competition through self studying. I gradually find out that I may be a research-type person.

After entering college, I got crushed on AI. I learned several courses about AI, which all achieve high scores. 
I also attended Mathematic Competition in Modeling two years in a roll and learned a simplified process of how to make a paper.
Till then, I was prepared for entering real research.

My research focus is mainly on Adversarial Learning. I have got a complete research experience in this field and committed a paper as the third author to CVPR. I also have a research experience about MLN Infer and has written a paper as the fourth author. You can see details in Publication part.

I love doing research and look forward to becoming a Phd student in the future.

Now, I'm looking for a self-funded summer research intern opportunity in 2021 summer.
