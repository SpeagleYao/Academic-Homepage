My name is Yao Yiran, a junior from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I love doing research and look forward to becoming a Phd student in the future.
My research focus is mainly on Adversarial Learning. I have got a complete research experience in this field and committed a paper as the third author to CVPR. 
I'm looking for self-funded summer research intern opportunity in 2021 summer.
