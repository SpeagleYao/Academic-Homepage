My name is Yao Yiran, a senior undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. **I am looking for a position for Ph.D. students.**

I love the enormous joy when thinking about how to solve hard but intriguing problems. The experience of both math and coding competitions since childhood gave me a good habit of thinking. I was arrested for the simplicity and powerfulness of AI after entering college, and during my self-training of AI, I came across Adversarial Learning. AI, so powerful as it looks on the surface, is so vulnerable as well. If we can figure out why AI is vulnerable and how to make it robust, we may have a deeper understanding of how AI works, and more reassuring machine learning models can be obtained to be used in critical situations.

At the beginning of my junior year, I started to research in Adversarial Learning. It feels so refreshing thinking and doing experiments every day, watching the performance of models improve bit by bit. My desire to pursue a Ph.D. becomes more firm. Now, I have got complete research experience in Adversarial Learning, in which I carried out experiments and independently, and also participated in method design and paper writing. I am looking forward to getting more research opportunities abroad.

My research interests have revolved around security in machine learning. The world relies more and more on machine learning models, so it poses a severe challenge to the robustness of models. Besides, people are more aware of the need to protect personal privacy, while the current technical means have not yet given people proper ways to protect themselves. Therefore, I regard adversarial learning and data privacy as crucial topics and I want to explore more about them.

<!-- Since my childhood, I have learned Mathematical Olympiad and participated in lots of math competitions. When I was in high school, I came across coding in class, which has the same fun as Math. Feeling obsessed, I learned C++, data structures, and algorithms by myself, and participated in Olympiad in Informatics. Thinking about these tricky problems and coming up with exquisite solutions always gives me enormous joy. It is during this period, with the gradual deepening understanding of my characteristics, I regard myself suitable for doing scientific research in the future. -->
